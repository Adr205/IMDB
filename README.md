### REST API routes for testing

#### Registering a user
To register a user, make a POST request to `localhost:5005/API/user`
with the following request body
```

{
    "userName": "<userName>",
    "email": "<email>",
    "password": "<password>"
}

```


####  Obtain a recommendation list
Consume the following endpoint `http://localhost:5005/api/imdb/?pref=<key>` replacing key with a number from 1 to 5. This endpoint is meant to be used after preferences have been registered.

And to obtain the recommendations in descending order just add the extra parameter _rating_ like this `http://localhost:5005/api/imdb/?pref=<key>&rating=false`
